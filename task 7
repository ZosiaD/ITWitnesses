'''
A lot of cell phones have tip calculators. Write one. Ask the user for the price of 
the meal and the percent tip they want to leave. Then print both the tip amount and 
the total bill with the tip included.
'''

a = int(input('Enter the price of the meal: '))
b = int(input('Enter a percent tip you want to leave: '))
print('Tip amount: ', (a * b) / 100,
     'Total bill: ', a + (a * b) / 100)
